    Mariposa is the alternative pvp modpack for Minecraft Java Edition, focused on pvp with minimal settings. 
  </p>
</p>

## Wait, why Mariposa? ##
Mariposa(Means Butterfly on Spanish) was born as new Lunar Client/Badlion Client alternative due to ignorant developers who does not listen to community and very bloated due to cosmetic feature included on their client.

Mariposa focuses on less-bloated and simple modpack which anyone can add their own mods and resource packs without limitation.

## Caution when using this modpack ##
We recommend using only mods which is safe to use on server. Since it is designed for pvp, it is not recommended to add mods which breaks the fair play of pvp. Remember that we have no responsibility for any damages and bans from other server.

## How does it works? ##
Mariposa works as pure forge, which allows you to add mods and resource packs freely, and does not include any forge modifications.
Due to modpack usage copyright difference between mods, we decided to not include any mods. You must add mods yourself included on the list below.
